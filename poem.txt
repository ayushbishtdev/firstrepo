In silence and code, the night gently hums,
A dreamer builds while the rest succumb.
Not with noise, nor fleeting fame—
But line by line, he carves his name.

Python whispers, logic flows,
Bug by bug, the learner grows.
A repo stands—his silent shout,
"I'm not done yet, just starting out."

The world may scroll, the world may sleep,
But dreams are sown when the roots run deep.
Not in comfort, nor in ease,
But in every quiet "I'll try again, please."

So rise, dear coder, chase no trend,
For mastery has no weekend end.
Commit your will, push through fear—
Your future self will thank you here.
